# To-Do
the very first project in Html, JS and CSS

#Note:
although this project is the easiest project ever known to humanity, it is my first and a lot more updates I endlessly gonna add, it is just sharing work in progress through this beautiful trip of learning

the project is as simple as any other to-do list project but the trick here is that I added an extra function of saving birthdays to your local(since I find it super hard to remember each and every birthday of a person I know) and it is super simple to 
actually get into the website and try some things maybe show me how I messed up big time in my first project.
